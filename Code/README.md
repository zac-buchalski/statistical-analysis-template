# Code

Place your analysis scripts here.

## Suggested Organization

- Use numbered prefixes for scripts that should run in sequence (e.g., `01_`, `02_`, `03_`)
- Separate data cleaning, analysis, and visualization into different files
- Include comments explaining the purpose of each script

## Examples

- `01_data_cleaning.R` or `01_data_cleaning.sas`
- `02_descriptive_statistics.R` or `02_descriptive_statistics.sas`
- `03_model_fitting.R` or `03_model_fitting.sas`
- `04_visualizations.R` or `04_visualizations.sas`
