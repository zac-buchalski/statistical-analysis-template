# Tables

Store generated tables and results here.

## Organization Tips

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `table1_demographics.txt`)
- Common formats:
  - CSV for data tables
  - TXT for formatted output
  - RTF/DOC for publication-ready tables
  - HTML for interactive results

## Version Control

Tables can be tracked in Git, which is useful for:
- Documenting how results change as analyses are refined
- Tracking statistical outputs over time
- Collaborating on results interpretation
