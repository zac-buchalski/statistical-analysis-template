# Figures

Store generated figures and plots here.

## Organization Tips

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `fig1_age_distribution.png`)
- Include figure numbers if preparing for publication
- Save in appropriate formats:
  - PNG for general use and presentations
  - PDF or SVG for publication-quality figures
  - TIFF if required by journal

## Tracking Figures in Git

Figures can be tracked in Git to show how visualizations evolve over time. However, consider file sizes and avoid committing very large image files.
